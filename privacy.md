# Privacy Policy for CaffMeter

**Last updated: December 25, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how CaffMeter ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### HealthKit Data
CaffMeter integrates with Apple's HealthKit to read and write caffeine consumption data.
* **Read:** We read your caffeine history to visualize your intake and calculate metabolic decay.
* **Write:** We write data to HealthKit when you log a drink, so your health records remain in sync.

We **do not** use HealthKit data for advertising or similar services. We **do not** sell your HealthKit data to third parties.

### Usage Data
We do not track your location, device ID, or personal identity. All metabolic calculations happen locally on your device.

## 2. Data Storage
All data is stored locally on your device. If you have iCloud backups enabled, your data may be stored securely in your personal iCloud account, managed by Apple. We do not maintain external servers that hold your personal health data.

## 3. Third-Party Services
The App may use StoreKit for processing subscriptions. These services may collect transaction data (like purchase history) to validate your "Pro" status, but they do not have access to your health data.

## 4. Your Consent
By using the App and enabling HealthKit permissions, you consent to the processing of your data as described in this policy. You can revoke HealthKit access at any time in your iPhone Settings -> Health -> Data Access.
